<h1>Styling Text With CSS</h1>
<h2>Include a variety of HTML elements</h2>

<p><a href="javascript:;" title="test link">Test link</a>. <strong>Strong text.</strong> <em>Emphasized text.</em></p>

<h3>Paragraphs</h3>
<p>Your test HTML must have multiple paragraphs, so you can check to see whether you've added margin between them to separate one paragraph from the next. It's also a really good idea to have a mix of lists and paragraphs, as each list (ul, ol, and dl) should have the same margin underneath it as your paragraphs do.</p>

<p>It's always a good idea to <a href="javascript:;">test your link styles</a>. Write global link styles first, then override with more specific selectors only as needed.</p>

<p>This is a third paragraph, so you can check to see how multiple paragraphs look. It's also a really good idea to have a mix of lists and paragraphs, as each list (ul, ol, and dl) should have the same margin underneath it as your paragraphs do.</p>


<h3>Blockquote</h3>
<p>This is a paragraph that comes before a blockquote. Use it to be sure your blockquote styles include sufficient white space above and below the blockquote.</p>

<blockquote>This is a blockquote. It should be styled differently from other text on the page.</blockquote>

<p>This is a paragraph following a blockquote. Use it to be sure your blockquote styles include sufficient white space above and below the blockquote.</p>

<h2>Heading 2</h3>
<h3>Heading 3</h3>
<h4>Heading 4</h4>
<p>It's a good idea to test out how a headline followed by a sub-head looks. Sometimes the white space between them needs to be adjusted.</p>

<h3>Unordered List</h3>
<p>This is a paragraph that comes before an unordered list. Use it to be sure your styles include appropriate white space between paragraphs and lists.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Unordered List Item 1. <strong>Do your unordered lists have bullets?</strong></li>
    <li>List Item 2. Are the bullets properly indented? I like to start by <strong>giving unordered lists a margin-left of 1.25em.</strong> I may then need to adjust the margin a bit to make the bullets align with the left edges of other content, such as the paragraphs above and below the list. I set my indent in ems so the bullets are properly sized no matter what font-size is used.</li>
    <li>Some List Items will break to more than one line of text. Be sure to add some margin-bottom to your list items to create vertical space between them. This makes it much easier to distinguish two different list items from one item that breaks onto two lines.</li>
    <li>Be sure to add white space below lists, so they don't get too close to the elements that follow them on the page.</li>
    <li>Here is a list item with a <a href="javascript:;">link</a> nested inside it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's a paragraph following an unordered list. Use it to be sure your ul has sufficient margin-bottom to separate the list from whatever follows it in your HTML. </p>

<h3>Ordered List</h3>
<p>This is a paragraph that comes before an ordered list. Use it to be sure your styles include appropriate white space between paragraphs and lists.</p>

<ol>
    <li>First Ordered List Item.</li>
    <li><strong>Do your ordered lists have numbers?</strong></li>
    <li>Are the numbers properly indented? I like to start by <strong>giving ordered lists a margin-left of 1.75em.</strong> I may then need to adjust the margin a bit to make the numbers align with the left edges of other content, such as the paragraphs above and below the list.</li>
    <li>I set my indent in ems so the numbers are properly sized no matter what font-size is used.</li>
    <li>It's a good idea to test an ordered list with at least 10 items, so you can be sure your left indents work with two-digit numbers.</li>
    <li>Be sure to add white space below lists, so they don't get too close to the elements that follow them on the page.</li>
    <li>Some list items will break to more than one line of text. Be sure to add some margin-bottom to your list items to create vertical space between them. This makes it much easier to distinguish two different list items from one item that breaks onto two lines.</li>
    <li>List Item 8 with a <a href="javascript:;">link</a> inside it.</li>
    <li>List Item 9</li>
    <li>List Item 10</li>
    <li>List Item 11</li>
    <li>List Item 12</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's a paragraph following an ordered list. Use it to be sure your ol has sufficient margin-bottom to separate the list from whatever follows it in your HTML. </p>

<h3>Nested List 1: ol ul</h3>
<ol>
<li>List Item 1
    <ul>
    <li>Nested List Item 1. Are your nested lists properly indented?</li>
    <li>Some List Items will break to more than one line of text. Be sure to add some margin-bottom to your list items to create vertical space between them. This makes it much easier to distinguish two different list items from one item that breaks onto two lines.</li>
    <li>Nested List Item 3</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>List Item 2</li>
<li>List Item 3</li>
</ol>

<h3>Nested List 2: ul ol</h3>
<ul>
<li>List Item 1
    <ol>
    <li>Nested List Item 1. Are your nested lists properly indented?</li>
    <li>Nested List Item 2</li>
    <li>Nested List Item 3</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li>List Item 2</li>
<li>List Item 3</li>
</ul>


<h3>Definition List</h3>
<dl>
    <dt>This is the Definition Term</dt>
    <dd>This is the definition description</dd>
    <dd>Does your definition term &lt;dt&gt; stand out from the description  &lt;dd&gt; ? (I generally make the &lt;dt&gt; bold, but this is optional and depends on your design.)</dd>
    <dd>Do your definition lists have hanging indents? Again, this is optional and depends on your design.</dd>
    <dd>Are the indents properly aligned? I like to <strong>give &lt;dd&gt; tags a margin-left of 1.25em.</strong> This makes them align nicely with the left edges of unordered list text.</dd>
    <dd>Some List Items will break to more than one line of text. Be sure to add some margin-bottom to your list items to create vertical space between them. This makes it much easier to distinguish two different list items from one item that breaks onto two lines.</dd>
    <dd>Be sure to add white space below lists, so they don't get too close to the elements that follow them on the page.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Here's a paragraph following a definition list. Use it to be sure your ol has sufficient margin-bottom to separate the list from whatever follows it in your HTML.</p>
