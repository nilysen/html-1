    <h2>About Us</h2>

    <p>The tradition of Viennese coffee house culture goes back to the end of the 17th century. Here at Vienna, we take our
        history, our coffee, and our community seriously.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p> &ldquo;&hellip;a sort of democratic club, open to everyone for the price of a cheap cup of coffee, where every guest
            can sit for hours with this little offering, to talk, write, play cards, receive post, and above all consume
            an unlimited number of newspapers and journals.&rdquo;</p>
